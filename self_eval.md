# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
It is useful if only some of your code will make something true or when you want your code to preform based on conditions.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
Make more commits to practice that. 
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
I think towards the end of this assignment when I was working on the if_statements.rb brought me the most satisfaction because I felt like I knew what I was doing and I was efficient with my time.
